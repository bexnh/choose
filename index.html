<!--1 Start-->

    <div class="container">
      <a name="Start">
      <img src="images/front.jpg" />
      <p>
        You step out into the <a href="#Front">Front</a> yard of an old Victorian home with your Father. Your Mother and Brother are gone already. The lights are on in the living room, and you can see the flickering of a TV.
      </p>
      <p>
        Back to your right there is a picket fence with a half-open <a href="#Gate">Gate</a>. Your Father strays towards the Front porch. What do you do?
      </p>
    </div>

<!--2 Front-->

  <div class="next">
    <a name="Front">
  </div>

    <div class="container">
      <img src="images/wide kitchen.jpg" />
      <p>
        You step up onto the porch to knock on the Front door, and as you do it creaks open. The <a href="#Living Room">Living Room</a> is to your right, with its flickering TV and an unlit fireplace. You find your Mother there, and she comes to stay by your side. You won't see your brother for a while.
      </p>
      <p>
        Straight ahead you see an empty <a href="#Kitchen">Kitchen</a>, and there's a particularly loud hum coming from the fridge. You turn to your Mother and Father. What do you do?
      </p>
    </div>

<!--2 Gate-->

  <div class="next">
    <a name="Gate">
  </div>

    <div class="container">
      <img src="images/upstairs.jpg" />
      <p>
        You open the Gate all the way and step through, as your Father enters the house. On the other side of the fence, a flowering vine grows from beside the gate along a short path towards the <a href="#Back">Back</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        As you peer along this side of the house, a lamp switches on in a room on the <a href="#Second Floor">Second Floor</a>. You wonder where your various relatives may be, relative to where you are. What do you do?
      </p>
    </div>

<!--3 Living Room-->

      <div class="next">
        <a name="Living Room">
      </div>

        <div class="container">
          <img src="images/dining.png" />
          <p>
            The three of you move into the warmly lit Living Room. Your Mother moves past the <a href="#Fireplace">Fireplace</a> into the <a href="#Dining Room">Dining Room</a>, your Father slowly fallowing her across the room.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Fireplace is empty and cold, almost drafty. Not almost; it’s open to a short dark tunnel you could just duck inside. What do you do?
          </p>
        </div>

        <!--3 Kitchen -->

              <div class="next">
                <a name="Kitchen">
              </div>

                <div class="container">
                  <img src="images/wide kitchen.jpg" />
                  <p>
                    You move forward, noticing in passing a set of stairs to your left. The Kitchen is brightly lit, with soft white light emanating from the <a href="#Fridge">Fridge</a>.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To you right you see the <a href="#Dining Room">Dining Room</a>, lights on but the wooden table unset, and your Mother and Father have already made their way inside. What do you do?
                  </p>
                </div>

                <!--3 Back-->

                      <div class="next">
                        <a name="Back">
                      </div>

                        <div class="container">
                          <img src="images/front.jpg" />
                          <p>
                            Passing by the light above, you move Back along the side of the house towards a colorful <a href="#Garden">Garden</a>, almost luminescent in the night.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            You glance back towards where you <a href="#Start">Started</a>, towards your Mother and Father­­. What do you do?
                          </p>
                        </div>

                        <!--3 Second Floor-->

                              <div class="next">
                                <a name="Second Floor">

                                  <p>
                                    You retreat until you can enter the house, blowing past other paths and possibilities with your excitement to get up the stairs. Here on the Second Floor, the lamp doesn’t hold your interest for long. To your right is a <a href="#Bathroom">Bathroom</a>, the black and white tiles making you dizzy for a long moment.
                                  </p>
                                  <p>
                                    Opposite is a <a href="#Bedroom">Bedroom</a>, where you are certain you will find a plush bed covered in soft blankets. What do you do?
                                  </p>
                                </div>

                                            You peek inside the Fireplace and know you could <a href="#Crawl">Crawl</a> though and exit somewhere outside, beyond, far from this home and your family.
                                          </p>
                                          <p>
                                            They are behind you, already exploring the empty <a href="#Dining Room">Dining Room</a>. What do you do?

                                                This Dining Room is empty save for you and your kin. Not even a trace of dinner or dinnerware mars the table. To your left is the cool glow of the <a href="#Kitchen">Kitchen</a>.

                                                The thought makes you hungry, and you consider taking this chance to <a href="#Dine">Dine</a>. What do you do?
